  <h3 class="tab">Puerta del Sol</h3>
	<p>Puerta del Sol is the bustling center of many of the main streets of Madrid. 
	In this square are historical sites as well as many flourishing businesses.
	Puerta del Sol is a great place to visit when trying to truly learn about some of the traditions survived by the people of the city.
	One of my favorite traditions is the New Year's tradition in the square.
	On New Year's, everyone gathers in the square to watch the fireworks over the famous clock overtop of the regional government building.
	When the clock strikes midnight, everyone eats 12 lucky grapes to the 12 bell tolls.
	There are many statues erected in the square as well. 
	The most famous and favored of these is the staute of King Charles III.
	This statue was created because of King Charles' many progressive reforms that earned him the title of Madrid's best mayor.
	If you are truly trying to learn about the culture and life in Madrid, do not hesitate to visit this slice of Madrid. For even more information, visit <a href="https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/puerta-del-sol">https://www.esmadrid.com/en/tourist-information/puerta-del-sol</a></p>
  <h3 class="tab">Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía</h3>
   <p>This Museum was not originally built to be a musuem. 
   Amazingly, the building was originally constructed to be a state of the art hospital.
	The hospital was originally constructed in the 16th century under the reign of King Felipe II as the San Carlos Hospital.
	In the 18th century, Carlos III decided to rebuild the hospital as he wanted the hospital to meet the new city standards.
	Unfortunately, when he passed away before construction was completed, the reconstruction of the building was put to a halt.
	There were many modifications and additions made in the years afterwards but the hospital was ultimately shut down in 1965.
	In 1977, the building was declared a national monument and in 1980, restoration's began.
	By April of 1986, the building was ready to open to the public as the Reina Sofia Art Center.
	In 1988, the three incredibly eye-catching steel and glass elevator towers were built.
	Since then, the only modification made to the museum is the permanent exhibit inaugurated in 1992.

  <h3 class="tab">Temple of Debod</h3>
   <p>The Temple of Debod was built back in 200 BC as an Egyptian temple. It was originally built to be a one room shrine to worship the Eqyptian God Amun. 
   The temple was sealed of in the 6th century and abandoned after Nubia's conversion to christianity. 
   In the 20th century, Egypt gave Madrid the temple as a gift for the construction of the Aswan Dam that saved certain areas from flooding.
   The Temple was rebuilt stone by stone in Madrid and opened to the public in 1972.
   This is a great place to visit if you are traveling on a budget as it is free to visit!

    <h3 class="tab">Puerta de Alcalá</h3>
   <p>Puerta de Alcalá is a great monument in Spain that was build back in 1778. 
   It was the first of it's kind after the fall of the Roman Empire which makes the monument older than some incredibly famous pieces areoud the world (like the arc de triomphe).
	Puerta de Alcalá was given it's name because it stands on the street of Alcalá. 
	It was built next to El Retiro Park in the center of Plaza de la Independencia.
	It was built by Francesco Sabatini and commisioned by King Charles III because he was unimpressed with the gate that had first welcomed him to the city back in 1759.
